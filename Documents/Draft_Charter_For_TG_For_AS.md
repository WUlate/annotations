W3C Annotation Applicability TG
A Task Group of the Annotations Interest Group
DRAFT

1. Convenor

2. Core Members

3. Motivation

A wide range of user scenarios for annotations of biodiversity data of different types have been identified by the community.  Historically, annotations were frequently used in the natural sciences museum community in the form of paper records including paper labels, termed annotations, carrying subsequent identifications or other information attached to of botanical specimens, and in the form of new labels carrying new identifications associated with lots of zoological or paleontological specimens.  Over the last several decades, multiple projects and initiatives hav have considered how to annotate digital biodiversity data resources.  Some of these user scenarioes include:  Annotation of regions of interest in images  (Morphbank, AudubonCore),  Annotations of regions of interest of 3D media objects (AudubonCore, the 3D TaskGroup).  Annotations of regions of interest in audio recordings (AudubonCore).  Annotations carrying data quality assertions (DQIG TG2) about biodiversity data sets and records.  Annotation proposing changes to mutable biodiversity data (AnnoSys, FilteredPush, DQIG TG2).   Annotations carrying subsequent identifications of duplicate sets of botanical specimens (AnnoSys, FilteredPush, DO).   Annotations carrying historical identifications from one member of a duplicate set of botanical specimens to other members of the set (AnnoSys, FilteredPush, DO).    

4. Goals Outputs and Outcomes

The deliverable from this task group will be an applicability statement on the use of the products of the W3C Web Annotation Working Group, in particular the Web Annotation Data Model and Web Annotation Vocabulary, providing guidance for how to use W3C annotations to carry assertions expressed in TDWG vocabularies in the biodiversity domain.

Phase 1 (to be completed by the TDWG 2021 meeting):
	Develop use cases, and competency questions for at least three different user scenarios of annotation of biodiversity media and data objects, covering at least three different business operations (such as making a biological determination of a resource to scientific name, associating a transcription of textual data in an image of a label with the image and the occurrence it is related to, or making a data quality assertion concerning an occurrence record)..  For each case, develop an example annotation using the W3C recommendations and relevant TDWG vocabularies.    In this phase the task group will identify motivations and selectors relevant to each use case, and draft example annotation documents based on the use cases and competency questions.

Phase 2 (to be completed before the TDWG meeting 2022):
	Develop a TDWG Applicability Statement on W3C, including guidance on appropriate structures of annotation documents and annotation metadata carried in those documents, which annotation metadata elements should regularly be filled in for biodiversity data annotation use cases, and describing use of motivations for particular domain operations, including potential needs for biodiversity domain specific motivation or other Annotation vocabulary terms.

The task group will also produce reference documents, which may be normative, or non-normative and part of or ancillary to the applicability statement providing guidance on use of Motivation terms for buisness operations in the biodiversity domain (for example, how do the annotation motivations classifying and identifying relate to the application of biological determinations of scientific name to a biodiversity resource), and providing examples of the use of annotations to carry information for particular use cases in biodiversity.

5. Strategy

Regular, at least monthly, working conference calls among the convenor(s), core members, and other participants, to advance the work.

The convenor and core members will communicate with the AC Interest Group, the 3D Task Group, and the BDQ Interest Group to assemble the use cases necessary for the creation of the deliverables, and to identify domain experts to phrase and review example annotation documents.   

Following the completion of Phase 1, the experience gained in Phase 1 will be used to guide the subsequent development of the Phase 2 deliverable.  


6. Becoming Involved

Anyone with an interest in annotation of biodiversity data may participate in the task group.

7. History/Context

It has been clear for many years that annotation is a concern that spans far beyond the scope of TDWG, and the TDWG annotations interest group has been observing developments outside TDWG.  In 2016, a consensus was reached in the Annotations Interest group that the products of the WorldWideWeb Consortium’s Web Annotation Working group are directly relevant to annotation of resources in the biodiversity domain, and that there is a need to develop a TDWG applicability statement providing guidance to the biodiversity community on how to use the .

8. Summary

The Annotations Interest Group is putting forward a charter for a Task Group to draft a TDWG standard in the form of an Applicability Statement to provide guidance to the biodiversity community on use of the W3C recommendations the Web Annotation Data Model and the Web Annotation Vocabulary for annotation of resources in biodiversity.
