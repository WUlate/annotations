TDWG 2020 Annotations Interest Group

Attendee list at the end



Agenda

(1) Reports from the Community
AnnoSys

    Production system, collecting annotations on occurrences

ALA

    Production system, in long use, collecting annotations on occurrences

iDigBio

    ePanda project, assertions linking literature to occurrence records with certainty metadata

BDQ IG

    Data Quality Test definitions, can make data quality assertions on occurrence records which could be expressed as annotations.

Extended Specimens/Open DS

    Potential transactional model for sharing occurrence data, natural fit to annotations

AC IG

    Working with sounds over last 6 months, segmenting sound into segments seems to have relationship to annotations.   Most multimedia types have similar issue of regions of interest to refer to.  Segmentation and attributing segmentation to an agent.

    Brief discussion of FilteredPush, look back to its experience, products, and use cases.


Attributions IG

    W3C annotation model seems good fit to needs.  Size of pipeline is a concern. Closed loop back to source desired.

(3) Discussion  of example Annotations

Determination applied to region of interest in image

Audio Region of Interest (in time domain)
https://github.com/tdwg/annotations/blob/master/Documents/example_3_audio_roi.json

Dan Stowell: Need to annotate points in time, time regions, and time/frequency regions. For frequency regions, this can be handled as an "extension" to the W3C model. However, the W3C Media Fragments time model *might* be rather limited since its syntax cannot express points-in-time. To consider.
  > https://iiif.io/api/annex/openannotation/#point-selector was created in the IIIF community to deal with points-in-time

Data Quality Assertion
